* Marvel United: X-Men App

This is a fan app for the board game Marvel United: X-Men. Currently I am cleaning and organizing the data.

** TODOS

- Reach out for villain data.
- Create MongoDB database.
- Add boxes collection with =_id=, =wave=, and =name=.
- Add =box= field to each hero, holding the box =id=. This can be done programmatically-ish with some JS arrays. See =convert.js= for an example.
- Add =anti-hero= with =true= to anti-heroes, similarly to the above step.
- Add =heroes.json= to a =heroes= collection.

** Potential DB Queries
